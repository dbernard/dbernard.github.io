Before we get started, let's make (my) perfect cup of coffee.

I'm personally a quality over quantity coffee drinker so it's important that my
morning coffee *really* scratches that itch. Here's how I do that...

## The Tools
We'll need the following tools to get this job done:
1. Your favorite mug (ideally small and wide)
2. A teapot
3. Breville Barista Express Espresso Machine (not an ad, just what I use)
4. A precision coffee scale with timer
5. A 54mm bottomless portafilter
6. 53mm spring loaded tamper
7. 53mm gravity-based espresso distributor
8. 53mm espresso dosing funnel
9. Espresso grind agitator
10. 53mm puck screen
11. Espresso knock box
12. Quality, fresh, whole coffee beans
13. Stainless steel milk frothing jug
14. Dial thermometer
15. Whole Grassmilk (milk from grass-fed cows... you can't milk grass)

## The Art

### Step 1: Boil Water
Add about 8 fluid ounces of water to your teapot and boil.

If you're already confused - no, this water isn't for the espresso. Read on!

### Step 2: Pre-warm Your Mug
Once boiling, turn off the heat to your teapot and fill your mug about half full
with the hot water. Let rest on the counter while your move on to the remaining
steps.

### Step 3: Measure Your Beans
With your precision scale, measure out **18.5 grams** of whole beans (*most
double shot portafilter baskets fit about 18g but this is heavily influenced by
the beans and grind size*). Add these beans to the hopper of the Barista Express
Machine's burr grinder.

> **NOTE**
> 
> *I configure my machine to use an internal grind size of 3, and external grind
> size of 3. This works for my beans, but YMMV.*

### Step 4: Grind Your Beans
Attach the dosing funnel to your portafilter, then push the portafilter into the
grind chute. **Hold the portafilter against the grind button to allow manual
grind duration**. Hold until all beans have been ground.

### Step 5: Agitate
With your agitator tool, gently stir the coffee grounds in a circular motion
until evenly distributed and all clumps are broken down.

### Step 6: Distribute
Press your gravity distributor into the portafilter holding your grinds. Spin
in clockwise and counter clockwise motions to evenly distribute the grinds
within the portafilter.

### Step 7: Tamp
Place the head of your portafilter flush against the counter with a small towel
between the portafilter and counter top.

Hold the portafilter handle with one hand and press the tamper down firmly into
the grinds until the tamper bottoms out. The spring loading will ensure
appropriate pressure.

### Step 8: Insert the puck screen
Insert the puck screen into the portafilter without breaking the surface of the 
tamped grinds. Ensure the screen is flush against the grinds.

This screen helps ensure even distribution of water during the extraction
process, which prevents channeling within the grinds.

### Step 9: Insert the portafilter into the machine
Press the portafilter up into the portafilter slot on the Barista machine and
turn counter clockwise to lock into place.

### Step 10: Prepare mug for brew
Pour the warm water from the now-warm mug.

Place the mug on your coffee scale and zero the weight. Place the scale with the
mug under the portafilter so that the espresso will drain into the mug.

### Step 11: Brew
With the mug under the portafilter, press and hold the **single shot** button on
the Barista machine. This will enter a manual brew, and holding the button
enters the pre-infusion state.

Hold the single shot button for **ten seconds**. This pre-infusion helps evenly
distribute water throughout the espresso grinds before the high pressure
extraction.

After ten seconds, release the single shot button to start high-pressure
extraction. Start the timer on your scale at this time.

When your scale reads **36 grams** of espresso in the mug, press the single shot
button again to end the extraction process.

### Step 12: Dump grinds
Remove the mug and scale from under the portafilter and set aside.

Twist the portafilter in a clockwise motion to unlock it from the portafilter
spout. Flip the portafilter upside down and firmly (but safely) knock the
portafilter against the knock box until the screen and spent espresso puck fall
into the bucket.

Remove the screen from the bucket and set aside with the portafilter for
cleaning (careful, it may be hot).

### Step 13: Prepare milk for frothing
Pour approximately 3 ounces of whole grassmilk into the milk jug and insert the
thermometer.

I prefer less milk in my latte.

### Step 14: Froth
Turn on the steam wand by turning the wand knob on the right side of the machine
to the "steam" position.

Wait until steam begins to flow, then submerge the wand into the milk in the jug.
Hold the wand so that the nozzle is just touching the milk surface at an angle
for approximate three seconds. This creates a small amount of foam.

After three seconds at the surface, fully submerge the wand into the milk.
Continue to hold at a slight angle until the milk within the jug begins to swirl.
Steam the milk until it reaches 160°F, then turn the dial for the steam wand to
the "off" position.

### Step 15: Add milk to espresso
With the frothed milk in the jug, gently tap the jug against the counter to
remove large bubbles from the surface.

Hold the mug with espresso at approximately a 45° angle and slowly pour the
frothed milk into the espresso in a circular motion.

### Step 16: Enjoy!
Sip, enjoy, and catch up on your morning emails.

## Final Thoughts
What makes something as simple as a cup of coffee so seemingly complex? I could,
for example, just add some instant coffee to water and call it done. Or I could
add 100 steps to the 16 above.

The result is a cup of coffee no matter the process, but the quality of that cup
is heavily influenced by the steps that we take to get there.

The software engineering process, much like making a perfect cup of coffee, is a
blend of precision and artistry. Engineering leadership requires that you
navigate these options and strike a balance based on what works best for you and
your organization.
