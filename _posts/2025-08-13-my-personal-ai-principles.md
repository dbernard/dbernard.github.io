# My Personal AI Principles
AI use in the Tech world has already become commonplace (with mixed feelings
from the community). As I have explored the usage of these tools in my own day
to day life both personally and professionally, I'm beginning to discover my own
personal set of "AI Principles", or **how I want to ground my own usage of AI
tooling in my beliefs and morals, but also in current reality**.

I expect these principles to change quickly and frequently as tools evolve, so I
will regularly reevaluate these principles to match new realities and fit them
to my own growth and evolving opinions.

## 1. Prefer human creativity when meaningful
Respect human innovation and creativity over all. AI would not be what it is
today without it.

Use AI for minimally creative endeavors when you can do so while still
respecting human creativity, such as aesthetic-only slide images for
presentations. Avoid AI usage that is harmful or disrespectful to human
creativity, such as copying popular art styles, artistic depictions, or as a
replacement for creative professions.

## 2. Approach AI solutions with healthy skepticism
Avoid settling into default acceptance of AI-generated solutions. When using AI
tools to solve problems, always understand what criteria the solution will be
evaluated against to be deemed "valid". Passing unit tests is typically not
enough, just as it wouldn't be enough for peer-generated solutions.

## 3. Plan and edit, but do not write using AI
Allow yourself to use AI tools for planning the establishing the general
structure of written documents, but do not use AI to generate the content of
your writing. You are "[One Voice In the Cosmic
Fugue](https://archive.org/details/cosmos2onevoiceinthecosmicfugue360p)" -
embrace this by allowing YOUR voice to carry on, rather than being a vector for
passing along AI output. AI is powerful, but it cannot create new ideas from
lived experiences.

## 4. Be human, but understand that AI agents are not
Human / AI interactions are typically conversational in nature, and it is easy
to start to feel like you are conversing with a real human. It can be
psychologically important to understand that you are not interacting with an
entity that has true thoughts and feelings, but this does not mean you should
lower yourself below your own standards for productive, respectful human
communication.

Conversational AI interactions are part of honing your regular communication
skills, and can be viewed as "practice" for how you might communicate with
others - communicate poorly often enough with AI and you may dull those skills
over time, affecting your human-to-human communications as well.

## 5. Understand how AI tools work, regardless of personal opinion
Regardless of opinions on the trajectory of AI and it's usage, take the time to
understand how these tools work. The current momentum behind AI tools will carry
them forward with or without you. Understanding how these tools work informs how
they affect you and your passions, and how you might best utilize (or avoid)
them to meet personal goals or improve your own skills.

## 6. Adapt to the realities of change in my profession, but stay true to strongly held beliefs
Pandora's box is open and enthusiasm for AI tools and their current and
potential uses is high and increasing daily. Be prepared to adapt to the
evolving technology landscape, but understand where your most strongly held
beliefs intersect with AI use, and don't sacrifice your own morals for the sake
of progress.
