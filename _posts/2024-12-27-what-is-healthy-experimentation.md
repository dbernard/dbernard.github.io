If you're supporting a technical product that has achieved some level of market
fit and success, you are likely running "experiments" (like A/B tests) to ensure
that the product iterates in the right direction.

Unsurprisingly, when you foster a culture of experimentation your organization
can trust that it is making the best decisions to support its goals, and healthy
experimentation is the key.

# What makes experimentation "healthy" or "unhealthy"?
Many factors can affect experimentation within your organization, and the
importance of these factors might differ from organization to organization based
on how that organization views experimentation.

At a high level, **healthy** experimentation is:
- **Trusted**. Stakeholders trust the data from experiments that your
organization runs. It is clear that the data collected is exactly what we
intended to target, and we can prove that.
- **Stable**. Technical issues are rare. We're able to easily run experiments
without delays or the need to disable and restart due to unforeseen issues
related to configuring our experiments.
- **Observable**. We're able to tell at a glance that our experiments are
working as we expect. Users are being exposed to treatments, exposures are
balanced, crossover users are minimal, etc.

This, of course, means that **unhealthy** experimentation might be:
- **Untrustworthy**. There is a history of issues related to running
experiments. Our stakeholders don't always trust results and must do additional
analysis to confirm that the results of an experiment represent reality.
- **Fragile, unstable, and/or high maintenance**. We often have issues defining
and running experiments. This leads to delays and extra work resolving these
issues, and heavily influences the level of distrust in our experiments.
- **Opaque**. We don't know if our experiments are working as intended, or
worse, we don't even know how to check. We usually don't find out about these
issues until a stakeholder highlights some issue with the data.

## Unhealthy experimentation can cause lasting damage
Poor experimentation health has an incredibly harmful side effect: **distrust**.

When an organization loses trust in it's experimentation process, it might start
to question its decision making (past and future). How can we be sure that
we've historically made the right decisions for the business and our customers
if we can't even be sure that our experiment results are trustworthy?

# Healthy experimentation drives healthy innovation

When we can use data to drive our decision making, we can prove that the
decisions being made are the right ones for the business. For this to be
effective, however, we need to trust that data and be able to understand how it
fits in the broader picture.

This in turn can help inform where our next and most impactful investments may
be.

## Healthy experimentation is an accelerator
When experiments are in a healthy state, we move faster. When our experiments
_"just work"_, when we can observe not just their health but also how the data
tracks against our hypothesis, and when we **trust** the process from end to
end, we can iterate more quickly and intentionally.

Every experiment that we run that doesn't require extra debugging or data
manipulation to identify an outcome means that we're able to instead focus that
effort on our next experiment. Healthy and trustworthy experimentation means that
each experiment is an iteration on our product that teaches us something new
and helps inform our next set of hypotheses.

Like [compound interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest), the
long term benefits of compounding these learnings and unlocking the next set is
an accelerator for the business, and can even be what gives your organization
the competitive edge.

## The big picture
Individual experiments in isolation can be incredibly informative, but the
archive of learnings across experiments is invaluable.

When experiments are trusted, stable, and observable (both while running and
historically), we grow this set of learnings more quickly and can apply it to
new explorations more easily. This can inform the "types" of efforts that we
pursue or the business level metrics that we should target for highest impact.

# Final thoughts
Experimentation is critical to an evolving product. That said, unhealthy
experimentation can be actively harmful to your organization and the business.
This harm can come in the form of **distrust** in your organization's
experiments, **instability** in your experimentation framework, and difficulty
understanding why all of the above might be happening.

As a result, unhealthy experiments can make the process of decision making feel
like wading through mud. When we finally do come to some conclusion, its usually
a bit unsatisfying due to the cloud of uncertainty hanging overhead. Worse yet,
if that conclusion turns out to be incorrect, our time is spent undoing the
damage rather than moving on to the next initiative.

Healthy experimentation and a culture that puts value on experimentation are
accelerators, allowing your organization to learn more about its customers and
product and to lean into these learnings to ensure that it is making the right
decisions. Experiments that run more quickly and without issue allow us to make
decisions more quickly, which in turn allows us to start the next iteration and
experiment.

This acceleration is similar to the notion of compound interest, allowing us to
leverage and build on past success and learnings to achieve even greater
returns.

product. The next chapter will explore trust as a fundamental pillar for
experimentation, and how you might achieve and maintain it.
